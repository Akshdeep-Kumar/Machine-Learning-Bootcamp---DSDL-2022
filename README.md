# Mobile Phone Price Prediction Model

## Description
This project was developed during a machine learning bootcamp conducted by DSDL in 2022. It features a model that predicts mobile phone prices based on user-specified inputs such as RAM, storage, and brand name. Exploration to several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Regressor.
